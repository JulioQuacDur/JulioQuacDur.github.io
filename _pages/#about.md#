I am a first-year PhD student at Durham University
under the supervision of [John R. Parker](https://maths.dur.ac.uk/users/j.r.parker/). 
I completed my bachelor's degree in mathematics at UNAM
in Mexico City, where I also took several courses 
in computer science. My main mathematical interests
are in hyperbolic geometry, and I am currently working on complex 
hyperbolic geometry, focusing on constructing fundamental domains 
for the actions of discrete groups in PU(2,1)
